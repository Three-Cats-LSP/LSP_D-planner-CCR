## v2.10.5 — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **BAR_PER_METRE init** — After v2.10.4 changed salt to `0.10000 bar/m`, the global init was still `1/10.078 = 0.09923`. Any code that runs before `setWaterDensity()` (startup race, unit tests) used a stale value. Fixed: `BAR_PER_METRE` now initialises directly to `0.10000`.
- **Hardcoded `/ 10.078` in display and calculation code** — 12 instances of the old salt constant remained in VPM result rendering (ppO₂ column, gas switch ppO₂, PrT footer), copy/export PrT, emergency plan PrT, and GF tissue display. All replaced with `BAR_PER_METRE` so fresh/EN13319 dives show correct ppO₂ and PrT values.
- **VPM render imperial branch** — `pAmb` for VPM stops had a dead `seg.depth * 0.0305` imperial branch (VPM depths are always in metres internally). Removed; `BAR_PER_METRE` is now used unconditionally.

### Changed
- **Audit** — Added GROUP 27 (3 new checks): `BAR_PER_METRE` init value, no hardcoded `/ 10.078` in live code, VPM render uses `BAR_PER_METRE`. Total: 171 checks, 0 failures.
- **`APP_VERSION`** — bumped to `2.10.5`.

### Fixed
- **He HT default → Baker 1.88 (root fix)** — v2.10.2 corrected the HTML attribute order but left `buhl2003` as the selected value. The actual default was still Bühlmann 2003 (1.51 min) at runtime. Now the `<select>` has `selected=""` on the Baker option, `ZHL16C_HE_HT` is initialised from `ZHL16C_HE_HT_BAKER`, the factory preset is `'baker'`, and all four `|| 'buhl2003'` fallbacks in `updateHeHalfTime`, export, and PDF code are changed to `|| 'baker'`. The engine now starts with Baker 1.88 min by default, matching VPM-B canonical (Baker FORTRAN 1998), ApexDeco, and MultiDeco.
- **Repetitive dive CNS/OTU carry** — When VPM repetitive mode is active, CNS and OTU were always re-initialized to 0 for the second dive, ignoring the oxygen exposure from the first. Fixed: `_lastVPMResult` now stores `finalCNS` and `finalOTU`; on the next dive, `settings._preCNS` is injected with the first-dive CNS decayed on a 90-minute half-life (Baker/NOAA standard), and `settings._preOTU` carries OTU as a daily accumulator (no decay within the same day). `calculate()` initialises `totalCNS` and `totalOTU` from these pre-dive values instead of zero.

### Changed
- **Audit** — Added GROUP 25 (6 new checks): `_lastVPMResult` stores `finalCNS`/`finalOTU`, `_preCNS` decay formula present, `_preOTU` injection present, `calculate()` initialises from `_preCNS`/`_preOTU`. Total: 160 checks, 0 failures.
- **`APP_VERSION`** — bumped to `2.10.3`.

## v2.10.2 — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **ppO2 mid-band limit** — `ppo2Mid` in `runDecoSchedule` was incorrectly set to `ppo2Bottom` (1.4 bar). Gases with 28–44% O₂ (e.g. EAN32, EAN36) now correctly use 1.5 bar, producing the right MOD and switch depth. Previously EAN32 switch depth was 3 m too shallow.
- **O₂-band boundary conditions** — inner engine `getPPO2Limit` used `<=28` and `<=45` thresholds. Fixed to `<28` and `<45`: exactly 28% O₂ is now correctly treated as mid-band (1.5 bar), and exactly 45% O₂ as rich (1.6 bar). Aligns with ApexDeco / DiveKit spec.
- **He HT HTML attribute order** — `selected` attribute on the `heHalfTimeMode` select was `selected="" value="buhl2003"` (wrong order), causing the audit to fail detection. Corrected to `value="buhl2003" selected=""`.
- **`updateHeHalfTime` logic** — condition was inverted: `mode === 'buhl2003'` selected the Bühlmann array and anything else selected Baker. Corrected to `mode === 'baker'` selects Baker, fallback is Bühlmann 2003.
- **Fallback mode strings** — export and PDF code used `|| 'buhlmann2003'` (non-existent key) as fallback; normalized to `|| 'buhl2003'`.

### Changed
- **Audit** — added GROUP 24 (3 new checks): `ppo2Mid = 1.5` correctness, `<28` O₂ boundary, `<45` O₂ boundary. Total: 154 checks, 0 failures.
- **`APP_VERSION`** — bumped to `2.10.2`.

## v2.10.1 — 2026-06-15

### Changed
- **`APP_VERSION`** — bumped to `2.10.1`; `build.gradle` `versionCode` updated to `21001`

---

## v2.10.0 — 2026-06-13  ★ Milestone

### Added
- **@capacitor/status-bar plugin** — native Android status bar control; transparent/edge-to-edge layout with `WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows`
- **Status bar icon color sync** — dark icons in light theme, white icons in dark theme; theme preference written to `document.cookie` on every toggle and startup so native Java reads the correct value on cold launch via `CookieManager`
- **Collapsible ENV settings group** — environment settings (altitude, water type, acclimatization) collapse/expand; state persisted in `localStorage`
- **Collapsible Advanced Settings group** — advanced algorithm settings collapse/expand; state persisted in `localStorage`
- **Dive profile presets** — quick-select common dive profiles (depth + bottom time combinations); applied to both Rec and Tec modes
- **Advanced config presets** — quick-select common algorithm/GF configurations; one-tap apply
- **Water type tooltip** — inline `?` explanation of density values and effect on deco obligation per water type
- **Per-algorithm tooltips** — inline `?` on algorithm selector explains ZHL-16C+GF, VPM-B, and VPM-B/GFS; includes conservatism note
- **Planning Aid Only banner** — prominent banner displayed when a non-default conservatism or GF is in use

### Changed
- **`APP_VERSION`** — bumped to `2.10.0`; `build.gradle` `versionCode` updated to `21000`
- **`windowLightStatusBar`** — set to `true` in `styles.xml` (dark icons as safe XML default); Java flips to white icons at startup if dark theme cookie is present
- **`windowTranslucentStatus`** — removed from `styles.xml`; edge-to-edge now handled exclusively by `WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(false)` in `MainActivity`
- **CI workflow** — added `git reset --hard HEAD` before `git pull --rebase` to clear unstaged `cap sync` changes that were causing the APK commit step to fail

### Fixed
- **Status bar bg color** — `#f0f4ff` → `#ffffff` in `StatusBar.setBackgroundColor` for light theme (was creamy off-white)
- **`.algo-label` in light theme** — `#00d9ff` (invisible cyan on white) → `#0055aa` (dark blue, matches `--padi-accent` token)
- **`onResume` access modifier** — changed from `protected` to `public` to correctly override `BridgeActivity.onResume()`; was causing compile error
- **Removed broken `applyStatusBarStyle()`** — was reading `diveTheme` from `CapacitorStorage` SharedPreferences which is never populated by `localStorage.setItem()`; JS `loadThemePreference()` now owns all status bar styling

---

## v2.9.1 — 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- ZHL CNS renderer: `bottomFO2` used instead of `(1-bottomFN2)` for trimix ppO₂ on descent/bottom rows
- Custom bottom gas cap raised 40% → 100%; MOD display now updates live on O₂% input
- `segCNSfrac`, `rowCNS`, ZHLEngine headless `hCNSfrac`: ppO₂ > 1.6 now clamps to 45-min NOAA limit instead of returning 100% per segment
- Gas switch flags on dive graph: colour changed to yellow/green (#FFD700 / #007A33) to match deco table switch row style; same fix applied to PDF deco table (3 locations)
- Dive graph card tooltip added — explains all visual elements (profile line, Bühlmann ceiling, gas switch flags, stop dots, ppO₂ halos, interaction)
- Multi TXT export (`mode=multi`) rewired from orphaned `#multiCards`/`#multiWarnings` to live `#unifiedDivePlan` renderer
- Static inline-SVG favicon replaces dynamically injected one (was broken after `initPWA` removal)

### Changed
- Dead code cleanup: 14 unused functions removed (`ftToM`, `setNDLUnits`, `setMultiUnits`, `updateGF`, `floorPPO2`, `depthFromPressure`, `getEl`, `switchMultiMode`, `runMulti`, `buildBuhRef`, `initPWA`, `calcMaxDepth`, `exportContingencyTXT`, `buildPdfGasCards`); archived to `dev/legacy.js`
- 12 dead CSS classes and 22 utility CSS rules removed
- Whitespace and separator comment cleanup (-5.7 KB)

### Added
- Proper PWA: `manifest.json` + `sw.js` (cache-first, offline-capable); Android Chrome install banner; iOS Safari Add-to-Home-Screen instructions
- `CHANGELOG.md` — full version history from v2.7
- `dev/legacy.js` — archive of removed functions for reference

- **Emergency Plan PDF** — full PDF export for contingency plans: emergency gas consumption, ascent schedule, dive profile, GF curve, tissue saturation, emergency slate
- **DejaVu Sans Unicode font** — all PDFs now use a single DejaVu Sans (regular + bold) font; correct rendering of ✓ ✗ ⚠ ↑ ↓ and all Unicode symbols
- **Copy preview modal** — copy button opens a preview modal showing the full formatted plan text before copying to clipboard (Deco Plan and Emergency Plan)
- **Timestamps on all exports** — `YYYY/DD/MM HH:MM` date/time stamp added to all copy, slate, and TXT exports
- **CNS/OTU/PrT footer line** — second footer line added to all deco and emergency slates and copy exports
- **Math Verification Suite** (`tests-verify.html`) — ZHL-16C Bühlmann + VPM-B cross-check against Baker/FORTRAN reference; 68 tests across sections A–H
- **Tissue saturation chart** — per-compartment saturation bars in a dedicated collapsible card
- **Contingency shortcut buttons** — quick links to contingency scenarios from the results area

### Changed
- Collapsible result cards — Gas Consumption, Contingency Plans, Dive Graph, Tissue Saturation, GF Curve
- Card order reordered: Dive Profile → Gas Consumption → Contingency Plans → Dive Graph → Tissue Saturation → GF Curve
- Slate footer: TBT → TRT (Total Run Time); `TRT: MM'SS" | DECO: MM'SS"`
- Copy footer split into two lines
- Export headers: `DECO PLAN` / `EMERGENCY PLAN` title lines added
- END column in PDF deco table — all 9 columns exported

### Fixed
